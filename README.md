👋 Hello developer!

This project contains a basic HTML structure to get you started. Check our tutorials for frontend development to learn the basics of HTML and CSS. 🦄
🏗 What's next?

Build your project however you like using HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

Use these four files as your starting point:

    README.md: This is the file that you are reading now. You can change the text in this file to leave information to others about your website - or delete it.
    index.html: This is the default page for your space, where you write HTML, the standard markup language for creating web pages.
    styles.css: Use the CSS file to style your content and change the look of your space with beautiful colors, fonts and much more.
    scripts.js: Use this file to make your website dynamic and interactive with JavaScript.

    Note: The styles.css and scripts.js files link into the index.html file so that they are all connected.
